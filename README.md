## Super Mario Bros: Custom Sprite ROM Hack

#### Description:
- This project is a custom ROM hack of the original Super Mario Bros for the NES. The main goal was to replace Marioâ€™s character sprite with a fully custom, original sprite using pixel art tools and ROM editing techniques. The modified sprite was manually designed and inserted into the ROM using the Mesen emulator, which provides built-in tools such as a hex editor and graphics viewer.
---
- The final result includes:
    - A personalized playable character replacing Mario
    - A patch file (.ips) for distribution and application on a clean game ROM
    - Experience with NES graphics formats, tile mapping, and basic 6502 architecture concepts

- This project was a hands-on dive into classic ROM hacking practices, emphasizing creative exploration and technical experimentation within the constraints of NES hardware.
